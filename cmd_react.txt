npm run start:front  -->react on 3000
npm run build --> make static file of react (no server runs)
npm run server:prod --> express + socket on 5000 (express will also serve build folder)
npm run server:dev --> nodemon (every change on backend gets reflected)

DEV → start:front + server:dev
PROD → build + server:prod

npm start   --> react + express + socket --> on 5000


npm install react-router-dom
npm install uuid
npm install react-hot-toast
npm install react-avatar
npm install codemirror

server :
npm i express
npm install -g nodemon
npm i socket.io socket.io-client

Proxy lets React talk to backend as if they are on the same server.
let, port 3000(react) uses proxy 5000(backend)
if req is for api/users on 3000
    if 3000/api/users does not exist
        than go for 5000/api/users
        remove cors issues


in express :
    npm i dotenv --> needed
in react :
    prefix must be : REACT_APP_
    as react runs in browser at user side 
    user/client can see all environment variables used by using browser dev tools
